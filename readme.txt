== Cocktail, an HTML/CSS rendering engine for the Haxe language ==

* With Cocktail, write HTML/CSS applications in Haxe and build them for NME and flash/Air. As Cocktail uses the standard DOM API, you can also build your app to regular JavaScript.

* Cocktail aims to implement the W3C HTML and CSS standards in Haxe.

* Use it by embedding it inside your app/game, like a WebView, and create your UI in HTML/CSS.
